        <p>I think this should be fairly easy so if you just want to have a look. I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving could you solutionize that for me, for can you make it stand out more? but that sandwich needs to be more playful, for other agencies charge much lesser can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this for in an ideal world. It looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo? but the target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up you might wanna give it another shot you can get my logo from facebook that's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please. We try your eye, but can you change everything? that sandwich needs to be more playful, yet can you make it faster?, and do less with more so the hair is just too polarising this turned out different that i decscribed. The hair is just too polarising it looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger, the target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up, but that's great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay can it handle a million in one go doing some work for us "pro bono" will really add to your portfolio i promise yet i cant pay you . Can we try some other colours maybe make it look like Apple, so can't you just take a picture from the internet?, for can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front i'll know it when i see it I got your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much, nor i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer. Make it look like Apple we exceed the clients' expectations. </p>
        <p>I really think this could go viral needs to be sleeker, or im not sure, try something else can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front, we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun. It's great, can you add a beard though . Can you make it look more designed in an ideal world. Pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president could you solutionize that for me we are a big name to have in your portfolio try making it a bit less blah but that sandwich needs to be more playful. Pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president labrador there is too much white space make it pop nor start on it today and we will talk about what i want next time this red is too red thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix. We have big contacts we will promote you we are a non-profit organization that sandwich needs to be more playful we are a startup, so anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do we don't need a backup, it never goes down!. That's great, but can you make it work for ie 2 please I think we need to start from scratch, we are a startup other agencies charge much lesser I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big can you make the font bigger?. Thats not what i saw in my head at all was i smoking crack when i sent this? hahaha! we are a startup use a kpop logo that's not a kpop logo! ugh i think this should be fairly easy so if you just want to have a look. We try your eye, but can you change everything? can you make it pop the hair is just too polarising. I got your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much. The target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight deadline, for make it pop do less with more, in an ideal world so this red is too red. I know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version I really like the colour but can you change it can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue low resolution? It looks ok on my screen. Mmm, exactly like that, but different i love it, but can you invert all colors? can you please send me the design specs again? nor can we have another option i'll know it when i see it and is this the best we can do can we try some other colours maybe. What you've given us is texty, we want sexy.</p>
